# Personal Blog

Welcome to my personal blog! This simple, static website allows me to share my thoughts and posts about different topics, along with updates on projects and learning experiences. It’s designed with a clean and minimalistic structure to prioritize content.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The blog adjusts to different screen sizes and is optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.
- **Dynamic Post Listings**: New posts are added through a `data.json` file, which dynamically populates the blog index page.
- **Simple Navigation**: Each post has its own page, and the main blog page displays all available posts with their metadata.

## Structure

This project has the following structure:

```
BLOG/
├── data.json            # Stores metadata for each post (title, date, description, link)
├── index.html           # Main page displaying a list of posts
├── posts/               # Folder containing individual post pages
│   └── post1.html       # A sample blog post page
├── script.js            # JavaScript to fetch and display posts dynamically
├── style.css            # CSS file for styling the blog
└── README.md            # This file
```

### **Main Components:**

- **`index.html`**: Displays a list of blog posts.
- **`data.json`**: Stores the metadata for each post (e.g., title, description, link).
- **`style.css`**: Contains the basic styling for the blog, including layout and colors.
- **`script.js`**: Fetches the data from `data.json` and displays it on the main blog page.
