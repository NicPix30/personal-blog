# My First Post: The Process of Creating This Blog Site

Published on November 20, 2024

Welcome to my first post! In this post, Iâ€™ll walk you through the process of creating my personal blog site. I wanted to keep things simple, focusing on a clean design and a minimalistic structure that prioritizes content. Here's how I built it:

## Planning the Structure

The first step was deciding on the structure of the site. I chose to keep everything as static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for simplicity. The blog will have an `index.html` page displaying a list of blog posts, each clickable to open the full article. For this, I used a `data.json` file to store the metadata of each post, such as the title, date, and description.

## Setting Up the Files

Once I had the basic structure in mind, I created the following files:
- `index.html`: The main page displaying links to each blog post.
- `data.json`: A JSON file storing metadata for all posts (title, description, link, and date).
- `script.js`: JavaScript to fetch and display the post data dynamically.
- `styles.css`: To define the look and feel of the site with a minimal design.

## Working with JSON and JavaScript

For displaying the blog posts dynamically, I decided to use JavaScript to fetch the data from `data.json` and render the list of posts on the main page. This allows me to easily add new posts without modifying the HTML every time.

## Next Steps

Moving forward, I plan to add more features like a comment section, a search bar, and a contact page. I also want to explore ways to automate the deployment of new posts using Git and GitHub Pages or Netlify.
