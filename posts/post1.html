        <h1>My First Post: The Process of Creating This Blog Site</h1>
        <p><strong>Published on November 20, 2024</strong></p>

        <p>Welcome to my first post! In this post, I’ll walk you through the process of creating my personal blog site. I wanted to keep things simple, focusing on a clean design and a minimalistic structure that prioritizes content. Here’s how I built it:</p>

        <h2>Planning the Structure</h2>
        <p>The first step was deciding on the structure of the site. I chose to keep everything as static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for simplicity. The blog will have an <code>index.html</code> page displaying a list of blog posts, each clickable to open the full article. For this, I used a <code>data.json</code> file to store the metadata of each post, such as the title, date, and description.</p>

        <h2>Setting Up the Files</h2>
        <p>Once I had the basic structure in mind, I created the following files:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>index.html</code>: The main page displaying links to each blog post.</li>
            <li><code>data.json</code>: A JSON file storing metadata for all posts (title, description, link, and date).</li>
            <li><code>script.js</code>: JavaScript to fetch and display the post data dynamically.</li>
            <li><code>styles.css</code>: To define the look and feel of the site with a minimal design.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Working with JSON and JavaScript</h2>
        <p>For displaying the blog posts dynamically, I decided to use JavaScript to fetch the data from <code>data.json</code> and render the list of posts on the main page. This allows me to easily add new posts without modifying the HTML every time.</p>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>Moving forward, I plan to add more features like a comment section, a search bar, and a contact page. I also want to explore ways to automate the deployment of new posts using Git and GitHub Pages or Netlify.</p>
