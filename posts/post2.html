        <h1>Progress, Milestones, and Opportunity</h1>
        <p><strong>Published on November 22, 2024</strong></p>

        <p>This week has been a whirlwind of effort, growth, and unexpected breakthroughs. It all started with sending out job applications—putting myself out there once again, hoping for an opportunity to break into the gaming industry. On a whim, I even reached out to a company that had ghosted me a month ago.</p>

        <p>The role was listed as "game tester," and the employer was confidential, so I had no idea who I was applying to at the time. To my surprise, they responded almost immediately, asking me to confirm my email so they could send over a test and schedule a meeting. That email revealed the company to be <strong>Global Step</strong>, a titan in game development, testing, and QA.</p>

        <h2>Global Step's Impressive Portfolio</h2>
        <p>Global Step’s resume is mind-blowing: they've worked on over 300 AAA games and more than 17,000 games in total. Their portfolio includes titles like <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Farming Simulator</em>, <em>A Plague Tale: Requiem</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, the <em>Horizon</em> games, <em>Marvel Strike Force</em>, <em>Tekken</em>, the <em>Tomb Raider</em> series, and so many more. They also develop games for major IPs without their own studios, including Mattel, the Olympics, Amazon, Netflix, and Nickelodeon.</p>

        <p>Late that night, I completed the test they sent. My plan was to follow up the next morning, but before I had the chance, they messaged me at 8:53 AM to schedule a meeting. The interview is set for next Tuesday.</p>

        <p>Through the meeting confirmation email, I found out that I'll be speaking with the Head of HR—fairly standard—but also the Head of QA. Here's the kicker: the QA lead worked for <strong>Gearbox Software</strong> for 13 years, overseeing QA for every <em>Borderlands</em> game and spin-off. <em>Borderlands</em>, for those who don’t know, is such a significant franchise that it recently got its own movie.</p>

        <p>All of this unfolded within three days—from a blind application with minimal details, a ghosted opportunity, and a hopeful follow-up message.</p>

        <h2>Personal Milestones</h2>
        <p>This week wasn’t all work, though. I hit a massive personal milestone at the gym: <strong>a 315-pound bench press</strong>! For context, that’s 100 pounds over my body weight and an iconic achievement because 315 represents three “plates” (45-pound weights) on each side of the barbell. In lifting culture, plates are a symbol of progression, and reaching three plates on the bench press is a benchmark many strive for. To put it into perspective, only about 1% of the global population can bench press 315 pounds, making it a significant accomplishment in the fitness community.</p>
        <p>On the creative side, I’ve been revisiting music. I decided to relearn the first song I ever tackled on guitar: <em>Buried Alive</em> by Avenged Sevenfold. A year and a half ago, this song felt out of reach—its technical complexity was beyond my skill level. But after picking it up again this week, I realized how much I’ve improved. I can finally play the entire piece the way I originally intended to.</p>

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>Looking ahead, my focus is on the upcoming interview. This game-testing role is a chance to prove my value, with the ultimate goal of transitioning to a development team. Adding that kind of experience to my resume could open doors to working at a major game studio—a dream I’ve been working toward for years.</p>

        <p>This week has been a reminder that persistence pays off. Whether it's reaching out to ghosted opportunities, pushing for new personal records, or revisiting old goals, growth happens when you keep moving forward. Here’s to what’s next!</p>
